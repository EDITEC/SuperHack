Create a new project in Eclipse, then copy the 'src' and 'res' folders, as well as the 'AndroidManifest.xml' file 
in to that project's directory that contains those same files and folders, replace and merge with existing content, then you
may delete the initial package created by the project, fix any missing or unwanted strings/resources and/or libraries.
